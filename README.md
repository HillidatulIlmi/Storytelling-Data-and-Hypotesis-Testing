## Storytelling and visualization
• Central Tendency

One of the most important aspects to describe the distribution of data is the value of the center of observation. There are four types of measures of central tendency used, namely Mean, Median and Mode.

• Dispersion

The size of the spread of data as a measure that states how big the deviation of the data values from the central value is. There are three types of spread measures that will be used, namely Range, Variance and Standard Deviation.

• Storytelling

Will be displayed in the form of a bar chart, pie chart, scatterplot which will explain the storytelling of the case based on the visualization results.

## Hypotesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a decision-making method based on data analysis, both from controlled experiments, and from observations (uncontrolled). After all the data is clean of missing values and oulier, the next stage of analysis can be carried out. The testing hypothesis that I use in solving the case of order items & products is One Sample T-Test One Tailed and Independent Sample T-Test.
